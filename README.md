# ECE 9609 Introduction to Hacking

* **Project topic**:  Introduction to Burp Suite

* **Team member**: Yuxuan Zhang, Jiayuan Yu, Boyu Li

* **Date**: Week 10, Mar 14

## Background
Burp Suite is a platform that contains different kinds of tools with many interfaces between them that are designed to facilitate and speed up processes of attacking applications. All these tools share the same framework for displaying and handling HTTP messages, authentication, persistence, logging, alerting, proxies and extensibility. Burp Site is used primarily to attack pentest web applications. It can also be used to read web traffic. Not only this app is useful and reliable. It also offers a lot of features. 
## Problem
We will learn how to use Burp Suite and plan to solve the web cache poisoning problem by using esoteric web features to turn their caches into exploit delivery systems, targeting everyone that makes the mistake of visiting their homepage. And we will try to control numerous popular websites and frameworks, progressing from simple single-request attacks to intricate exploit chains that hijack JavaScript, pivot across cache layers, subvert social media and misdirect cloud services.
